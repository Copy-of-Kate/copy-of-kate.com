      <p>She awoke slowly, light starting as pinholes in her vision eventually expanding to a brightness only the snowbound would know in the middle of the day. Her right arm was numb, she had fallen on it cutting off circulation. She rolled over now feeling the sharp cold of the cement floor which was accentuated by the lonely sound of the wind occasionally picking up and fading away every few moments.</p>

      <p>How many days this time?</p>

      <p>She needed water, badly. Even snow would do at this point, anything. Feeling was returning to her arm in the form of tension and needles. Standing now with a stumble into the nearest wall, she started making for her cell shuffling at first, but picking up speed. There was a heated slab to rest upon, and hopefully, fresh water, if the solar panels weren't completely covered in snow.</p>

      <p>At least some power was working. As she rounded the corner to the cell block the motion sensors were turning lights on and off for her as she walked, this was a good sign. She didn't feel quite like getting suited up to go outside to clean the panels again.</p>

      <p>She entered the cavernous cell block, her section a group of five hundred, the patter of her quick slippered steps was the only sound aside the wind. Up two flights of stairs to her cell, 388, and she was home. She did the best she could with what she had to make the place more comfortable. There was a small end table, lamp, and tablet she took from the warden's office. The walls were adorned with spare blankets as if they were miraculous tapestries from an old museum. Covering the stainless steel sink was a small piece of wood, on which sat her personal terminal, cobbled together from spare Controller parts.</p>

      <p>Slowly lying down on the heated slab meant for sleep, her breathing began to slow as her body warmed up and the tension from her chills subsided. She reached down to grab her water bottle and emptied it ravenously.</p>

      <p>Need more.</p>

      <p>There were no jackets or cold gear aside from the suits needed to go outside, she had only a few identical uniforms left that weren't tattered in rags. Feeling particularly cold still, she layered what she had on top of what she was wearing already.</p>

      <p>Maybe a storm outside?</p>

      <p>After wrapping a shirt around her head, she walked back downstairs with her two empty water bottles and headed for a deeper section of the prison where the water was still running. As she walked she felt a cold breeze which stopped her in her tracks. This section of the prison was so disconnected with the outside world that it shocked her to feel the air moving. The wind outside could be heard whistling loudly, something she had ignored since she woke up, but now that she was focusing on it she knew it was different from the average ambient noise.</p>

      <p>Finding the direction that the wind was coming from was difficult. It wound about the halls in strange ways. In the end she followed the cold, and followed it right for the collapsed wall which was the cause of the cold wind reaching the depths of her fortress prison. Several boulders broke through in an apparent landslide that must have occurred while she slept. It was bitterly cold outside, and the wind was rushing inside in its ever forward march toward equilibrium, this would eventually make all of the prison a similar temperature to the outside world. An outside world that had been covered in snow for decades.</p>

      <p>The collapsed wall left a hole more than a dozen meters high, double that in width. This was impossible to repair by herself, even if she had the necessary knowledge for structural engineering or materials. The cold shook her out of shock and she turned on her heels and started to run back toward the center of the prison. The complex was vast, but she had to assume the cold would overtake her if she didn't immediately try to stop it.</p>

      <p>The collapsed wall was in a bad place, fairly central. There were a few large vault-like doors in key locations she could close and possibly keep portions of the prison a reasonable temperature. She rounded a corner and came up on the first of the doors. They were meant to shut down parts of the prison in case of an emergency, like a riot, but still allow for Controllers to move freely to other sections. She would have to close four of the six doors to keep one wing of the complex safe. Unfortunately, her room was directly connected to the collapsed wall with no vault doors in between, so she would be moving no matter what.</p>
